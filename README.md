## Sample Queries

### Quick Analytics
```sql
-- OAuth Connections by App
SELECT APP, Count(*) as ConnectionCount FROM
(SELECT * FROM DATA_ROOM.MONGODB.CONNECTIONS WHERE HTTP:auth:oauth is NOT NULL) 
Group by APP ORDER BY ConnectionCount desc

-- User Tier Analysis
SELECT CASE 
    WHEN u.emaildomain='celigo.com' THEN 'internal'
    WHEN nc.customer_segment = '' THEN 'free' 
    ELSE nc.customer_segment END tiers,
IFF(u.subdomain is null, 'NA', 'EU') domain,
count(distinct c._userid) from connections c
-- ... (full query in Query Builder)

-- Recent Anomalies
select * from influxdb.anomaly_events order by time desc limit 50
```
